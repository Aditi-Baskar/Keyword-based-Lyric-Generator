"I ended up not having much to say
Said ""Today is for the lovers and the leaders
I hate to tell you, it just ain't your day""
So this is my rain song
It's cold outside and I still love you
Guess I was dead wrong
You'll find out when there's clouds above you
Finding it ain't worth losing you
When it all comes down
It comes down to
This only rain song
You're on my mind and I still love you
And it's a complication with the voices
Rounding all around inside my mind
I used to think this heart had lots of choices
But they all lead to your doorstep every time
This is my rain song
It's cold outside and I still love you
Guess I was dead wrong
You'll find out when there's clouds above you
Finding it ain't worth losing you
When it all comes down
It comes down to
This only rain song
You're on my mind and I still love you

This is a song for you

"I think you fell off of your cloud today
You didn't see it coming or did you
You tried to please everybody
But the sweet breeze swept you away

The sun goes down on a good day
Tomorrow is still an unknown
You think you're all alone in this place
I think you're crazy 'cause I still love you baby

Oh don't fade away baby
Blowing in the wind is getting harder to do
Don't count the days as they leave you
Count them as you find a day new
Don't fade away
Never fade

Hard to breathe, nobody knows it's you
Somebody blows your candle out
You wore a mask, now that's broken too
Everybody else was everything to you
The sun goes down on a good day
Tomorrow is still an unknown
You think everybody wants a fight
I think you're crazy 'cause I still love you baby

Oh don't fade away baby
Blowing in the wind is getting harder to do
Don't count the days as they leave you
Count them as you find a day new
Don't fade away

I think you fell out of the sky today
I think you know it's true
You've seen the world, now all you see is me
Tell me now baby what are you gonna do

"Your feet under the table
I love it when they're touching mine
Your hands make the crisps at the cradle
To tell me everything is fine
All I see is you looking at me

Do you know when you go
You make the sweetest sight at the window
If you had never come out of the blue
I would have stayed up and Made Up You

You smile just like a picture
It doesn't even need a frame
Sometimes I wait to answer
Just to hear you say my name
And all I want is just what I've got

Do you know when you go
You make the sweetest sight at the window
If you had never come out of the blue
I would have stayed up and Made Up You
I'd never let you go
Even If I could
Cause I never could've dreamed you up this good

"I want it all to appear before my eyes when he smiles
Maybe I'm wrong but I don't think Romeo would be my kind of guy
I want a love that's sweeter than roses
And for me this is how it's gonna be

Like there's a fairytale guy
And he whispers sweet lullabies
And the music plays from nowhere
As we dance in the pale moonlight
With candles and fireflies all night
Everybody thinks about love
I want love they haven't thought of yet

Here on the couch with a box of chocolates that I bought myself
I'll wait it out but sometimes my patience just needs a little help
It's what you get when your heartstrings are so tied
I don't regret it 'cause it needs to be perfect

"Here in my mind the sky looks the same
On every day you loved me
When we started home it started to rain
You put your coat around me
We stood there in the road
You held me so close
But did you ever let go

Down came the rain
Lightning and thunder
We tried in vain
To hold on to each other
Winds of change blew you away from me
Right here right now, I feel it on my skin
The bitter sting of what we couldve been
Just when our love was like a burning flame
Down came the rain

In through the window I see her with you
Im soaked to the skin, youre warm and dry
I guess the storm is over for you
But look at the tears here in my eyes
I just stood there like a ghost
As you held her so close
And as I let you go
Down came the rain
Lightning and thunder
We tried in vain
To hold on to each other
Winds of change blew you away from me
Love like this changes who you are
Every kiss you gave me is a scar
Just when our love was like a burning flame
Down came the rain

All I need is to move on fast
But all I want is to have you back
And it just keeps falling

Down came the rain
Lightning and thunder
We tried in vain
To hold on to each other
Winds of change blew you away from me
Right here right now, I feel it on my skin
The bitter sting of what we couldve been

"Standing on a street somewhere I don't wanna be
In a town that's made of stone
Some bad directions must have me here by mistake
'Cause this sure ain't what I call home

Let me close my eyes for a second
See if I can get out of here, and

Let my hair hang down, and I can feel the golden sun
And watch a pickup truck drive by
And I wanna tell the world how good it is to be right here
But I don't, I just sit under this tree
And I'm in Tennessee

Standing on a road leading to a barn
With a cat named Eloise
Later on, we'll all go fishing in the pond
But all we'll catch is just a summer breeze

Let me close my eyes for a second
See if I can stay right here, and
Let my hair hang down, and I can feel the golden sun
And watch a pickup truck drive by
And I wanna tell the world how good it is to be right here
But I don't, I just sit under this tree
And I'm in Tennessee

When the pond is gone and Eloise floats away
I find myself staring at the same old day
I need to go back, back to where I feel so free
Well, it looks like I'm going back to Tennessee

I let my hair hang down, and I can feel the golden sun
And watch a pickup truck drive by
And I wanna tell the world how good it is to be right here
But I don't, I just sit under this tree
Just me and Eloise

"Walking downtown shuffling my feet
I try to dream my dreams above the concrete
Store windows, traveled for miles
But something I passed really caught my eye
It was cracked down the middle, permanent scars
But I fell in love with this here guitar

Nice to meet you, can I teach you
All I know, can you show me what you do
Where have you been
What have you seen
Who were you before you even knew me
Have you been played for endless hours
Or were you left in the corner
Or were you someone's best friend
This here guitar

It was my baby, anyone could see
I love the cracks, the curves, the hidden beauty
But I can't help wondering why
It came to me and where we'll say goodbye

Or were you left in the corner
Or were you someone's best friend

Were you a present from a father to a son?
Did he forget you
Or just play you 'til you came undone?
Hey, did some primadonna love you
'Til she got her fame and fortune?
I won't do that to you

Nice to meet you, can I teach you
All I know, can you show me what you do
Where have you been?
What have you seen?
Who were you before you even knew me?

Or were you left in the corner

"It was painted red, the stripe was white
It was 18 feet from bow to stern light
Secondhand from a dealer in Atlanta
I rode up with daddy when he went there to get her
We put on a shine, put on a motor
Built out of love, and made for the water
Ran her for years, until the transom got rotten
A piece of my childhood will never be forgotten

It was just an old plywood boat
75 Johnson and an electric choke
A young girl, two hands on the wheel
I can't replace the way it made me feel
And I would turn her sharp
I would make it whine
He'd say, ""You can't beat the way a old wood boat rides""
Just a little lake across the Alabama line
But I was king of the ocean
When Daddy let me drive

Just an old half ton short bed Ford
My uncle bought new in '64
Daddy got it right cause the engine was smoking
A couple burnt valves and he had it going
He'd let me drive her when we haul off a load
Down a dirt strip, we'd haul trash off of Thigpen Road
I'd sit up in the seat and stretch my feet out to the pedals
Smiling like a hero who just received his medal
It was just an old hand-me-down Ford
With 3 speed on the column and a dent in the door
A young girl, two hands on the wheel
I can't replace the way it made me feel and
I would press that clutch
And I would keep it right
He would say a little slower, girl
You're doing just fine
Just a dirt road with trash on each side
But I was Mario Andretti
When Daddy let me drive

Soon I'll be grown up
With daughters of my own
I let them drive my old jeep
Across the pasture at our home
Maybe one day they'll reach back in their file
And pull out that old memory
And think of me and smile
And say

It was just an old worn out jeep
Rusty old floor boards
Hot on my feet
A young girl, two hands on the wheel
I can't replace the way it made me feel
And he'd say
Steer it left, and turn it right
Straighten up girl now, you're doing just fine
Just a little valley by the river where we'd ride
But I was high on a mountain
When Daddy let me drive
Oh, he let me drive
Oh, he let me drive

"""Now I'm gonna deal you a queen from the winning hand. Her voice is full like solid gold, with some platinum blended in. Sometimes you'll hear silver when she twists and twirls her notes... but gold is Brenda's metal in this song I wish I'd wrote. Ladies and gentlemen... Brenda Lee.""
The camera then focuses on a woman in her late thirties. The music starts, and she's looking down at a framed picture. She's at ease. She is theatrical. And she is beautiful, in a sparkling gown that matches the twinkle in her eye. Lights, camera, action. She starts to sing. That's when you hear the gold, and you watch her as she holds the crowd in the palm of her hand. The performance ends, and the crowd goes wild. The lovely lady graciously takes a bow. She smiles out into the vast darkness, taking it all in with grace and composure. The video ends, and I reflect back on what I just saw. It was a timeless performance, but here are the facts: The year is 1983. The song is ""Someone Loves You Honey."" The man in the tuxedo is Johnny Cash. And the woman in the beautiful dress with the honey-like voice is none other than Brenda Lee.
Brenda Lee, who was born in 1944 near Atlanta and used her prodigious singing talent to support her family after the tragic death of her father. Brenda Lee, the little girl who took over the music world with chart-topping hits when she was still a child. Brenda Lee, the woman who ushered in a new style of rock & roll and was one of the early musical artists to find her fame through television. Brenda Lee, the artist who later went back to her country roots, proving that she could create classics and break down barriers no matter what genre or category her music fell under. Brenda Lee, the singer who mastered the sound of heartbreak so flawlessly that she made audiences not only identify with her but believe her.
I watch the look on her face as she ends her song and first hears that applause. There's a reason she's been able to move people to their feet for almost sixty years. Brenda Lee is grace. Brenda Lee is class and composure. And when she hears the roar of a crowd, Brenda Lee smiles like she's five years old and receiving her first standing ovation. Brenda Lee is someone I will always look up to because of the way she shines. As Johnny Cash said in 1983, it's almost like she's golden.See Taylor Swift LiveGet tickets as low as $",I'm so glad you took my time To sing the songs I sing to you I'm so glad you took my time To sing the songs I sing to you I'm so glad you took my time To sing the songs I sing to you I'm so glad you took my time To sing the songs I sing to you I'm so glad you took my time To sing the songs I sing to you I'm so glad you took my time To sing the songs I sing to you I'm so glad you took my time To sing the songs I sing to you I'm so glad you took my time To sing the songs I sing to you I'm so glad you took my time To sing the songs I sing to you I'm so glad you took my time To sing the songs I sing to you I'm so glad you took my time To sing the songs I sing to you I'm so glad you took my time To sing the songs I sing to you I'm so glad you took my time To sing the songs I sing to you I'm so glad you took my time To sing the songs I sing to you I'm so glad you took my time To sing the songs I sing to you I'm so glad you took my time To sing the songs I sing to you I'm so glad you took my time To sing the songs I sing to you I'm so glad you took my time To sing the songs I sing to you I'm so glad you took my time To sing the songs I sing to you I'm so glad you took my time To sing the songs I sing to you I'm so glad you took my time To sing the songs I sing to you I'm so glad you took my time To sing the songs I sing to you I'm so glad you took my time To sing the songs I sing to you I'm so glad you took my time To sing the songs I sing to you I'm so glad you took my time To sing the songs I sing to you I'm so glad you took my time To sing the songs I sing to you I'm so glad you took my time To sing the songs I sing to you I'm so glad you took my time To sing the songs I sing to you I'm so glad you took my time To sing the songs I sing to you I'm so glad you took my time To sing the songs I sing to you I

So go easy on","I'm like the water when your ship rolled in that night You said you'd pull the ball back and put it in a ditch You're now in the fight, and I'm gonna cry like a thousand voices Say you're sorry, you're sorry You're still a mess, and I'm gonna cry like a thousand voices Say you're sorry, you're sorry You're still a mess, and I'm gonna cry like a thousand voices Say you're sorry, you're sorry You're still a mess, and I'm gonna cry like a thousand voices Say you're sorry, you're sorry You're still a mess, and I'm gonna cry like a thousand voices Say you're sorry, you're sorry You're still a mess, and I'm gonna cry like a thousand voices Say you're sorry, you're sorry You're still a mess, and I'm gonna cry like a thousand voices Say you're sorry, you're sorry You're still a mess, and I'm gonna cry like a thousand voices Say you're sorry, you're sorry You're still a mess, and I'm gonna cry like a thousand voices Say you're sorry, you're sorry You're still a mess, and I'm gonna cry like a thousand voices Say you're sorry, you're sorry You're still a mess, and I'm gonna cry like a thousand voices Say you're sorry, you're sorry You're still a mess, and I'm gonna cry like a thousand voices Say you're sorry, you're sorry You're still a mess, and I'm gonna cry like a thousand voices Say you're sorry, you're sorry You're still a mess, and I'm gonna cry like a thousand voices Say you're sorry, you're sorry You're still a mess, and I'm gonna cry like a thousand voices Say you're sorry, you're sorry You're still a mess, and I'm gonna cry like a thousand voices Say you're sorry, you're sorry You"
"I let my heart decide the way
When I was young
Deep down, I must have always known
That this would be inevitable
To earn my stripes, I'd have to pay
And bare my soul
I know I'm not the only one
Who regrets the things they've done
Sometimes I just feel it's only me
Who can't stand the reflection that they see
I wish I could live a little more
Look up to the sky, not just the floor
I feel like my life is flashing by
And all I can do is watch and cry
I miss the air, I miss my friends
I miss my mother, I miss it when
Lif was a party to be thrown
But that was a million years ago
When I walk around all of th streets
Where I grew up and found my feet
They can't look me in the eye
It's like they're scared of me
I try to think of things to say
Like a joke or a memory
But they don't recognize me now
In the light of day

Who regrets the things they've done
Sometimes I just feel it's only me
Who never became who they thought they'd be

I feel like my life is flashing by
And all I can do is watch and cry
I miss the air, I miss my friends
I miss my mother, I miss it when
Life was a party to be thrown
But that was a million years ago
A million years ","I remember the days when I leaned in front of you, and I sat down on your knees Then back to your car And I was looking at you like a child You used to be a car rider before you even knew I was a saint And I remember the days when I leaned in and cried like a child And I remember the nights when you took me home And I remember the nights when you took me home And I remember the nights when you took me home And I remember the nights when you took me home And I remember the nights when you took me home And I remember the nights when you took me home And I remember the nights when you took me home And I remember the nights when you took me home And I remember the nights when you took me home And I remember the nights when you took me home And I remember the nights when you took me home And I remember the nights when you took me home And I remember the nights when you took me home And I remember the nights when you took me home And I remember the nights when you took me home And I remember the nights when you took me home And I remember the nights when you took me home And I remember the nights when you took me home And I remember the nights when you took me home And I remember the nights when you took me home And I remember the nights when you took me home And I remember the nights when you took me home And I remember the nights when you took me home And I remember the nights when you took me home And I remember the nights when you took me home And I remember the nights when you took me home And I remember the nights when you took me home And I remember the nights when you took me home And I remember the nights when you took me home And I remember the nights when you took me home And I remember the nights when you took me home And I remember the nights when you took me home And I remember the nights when you took me home And I remember the nights when you took me home And I remember the nights when you took me home And I remember the nights when"
