In a getaway car 
No they never get far 
No nothing good starts in a getaway car 

It was the best of times the worst of crimes

Standing next to her 
was a love that was really something 
not just the idea of something 
When she finally rose she rose slowly 
Avoiding old haunts and sidestepping shiny pennies 
Wary of phone calls and promises 
Charmers dandies and 
When she stood she stood with a desolate knowingness 
Waded out into the dark wild ocean up to her neck 
Bathed in her brokenness 
Said a prayer of gratitude for each chink in the armor
