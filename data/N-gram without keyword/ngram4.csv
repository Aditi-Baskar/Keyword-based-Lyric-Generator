"Someone struck a match against the night when you said Forever and always 
Oh and it rains in your bedroom 
Everything is wrong 
It rains when you gone 
I was nowhere to be found 
And they say little girls have big dreams 
And how you left them all to me 
I sure that you got a mean streak 
That makes me run for cover when you around 
And there nothing like a mad woman 

Now you hang from my lips 
Forever the name on my lips ooh 

They burning all the witches even ",1
"My momma stood across the room holding her hand 
I take this magnetic force of a man to be my old self again but I still a believer but I do I do 

Drew talks to me 
And we were happy 
We were flyin but we never get far 
No nothing in the world tonight 
Your little eyelids flutter you dreaming 
So I fly all around the world 
In the middle of the night 
I threw my phone across the room at you 
There a girl that you want me 
When you realized I ",1
"She's looking in the mirror looking back at you 
There ai no accidents in what we do 

So you leave no trace behind 
Like you run from the law 
Darling let run 
Run from it all And we run and we run for the fences 
Sit with you in the rain so 
Come feel this magic in the air 
It must be exhausting always rooting for the 

Sometimes in the middle of the night in my dreams 
You should see the things we do baby 
In the garden would you trust me ",1
"Walked into a chair leg you were a better man 
Sometimes in the middle of the night I nearly lost you 
I do belong and my beloved neither do you 


Call a cab lose my number 
You about to lose your face 
look at your face Look at your face Look at your face gorgeous 
And I said Oh my my my

"Here I am, once again when nobody had to know the pain was heaven 
And I hope the sun shines and it a beautiful day 
And I got that red lip classic thing that you like me 

We might still be in love if you were a better man 
And I was never quite a fan of your games 
It does take too long to see that you lost 
You would know what I mean 
Wan na see what under that attitude like Yeah 
I do know why 

I dress to kill my time ",1
"I know we've got a lot to say your name 
And everything has changed 
All I know is a simple name 
And everything has changed 

All of the girls you loved before 
But I just miss you and I just wish you were a better man 

We go walking down the streets in his old white I always remember 
This pain would be for 
Evermore 
This pain you thought would last forever and ever 
Broke your heart I put it back together 

Yeah 
We take this way too far 
It leave you ",1
"I need you more than I know how to mention him 
In my monologue 
I like to keep you 
And I roll my eyes and see a surprise 
It like a present that you open 
Oh and it troubles me so oh 

Tossing turning 
Struggled through the night with someone new 
And that the way I loved you in the trenches 
Give you one last wave 
Maybe you drop what you doing to me 
But by then you be Too late 
Goodbye Perfectly fine 
How your heart after breakin mine 
Always at the right time ",1
"The way you look, the way you laugh 
When you ca stop thinking about her 
There a girl that you want me then push me around 
And the first night that you saw me 
I bent the truth too far tonight 
I was taken by the view 

Like we made of starlight starlight 
Like we were somewhere else 
Stumbled down pretend alleyways 
Cheap wine make believe it champagne 
I was lettin up until the day he 
No no no no no 
You left me no 
You left me no 
You should known that ",1
"Here you are now calling me up 
You loved the amber skies so much 
Its on your face oh

They paint me out to be just trees 
When the sun goes down 
But it would been fine 
And that the way shit always ends 
You were mine to lose no 

Come on baby with me 
And you said it reminded you of me 
Baby that the fun of you Makin fun of you 
Baby let the games begin 
Are you ready for it ",1

Tonight I gon na dance 
For all that we been through 
But I ai going down til they break it up 

I could gone on as I was

You meet some woman on the internet and take her home

My only one 
Who seems to care 
American stories burning before me

You were breaking down

Wait there in the back of the car 
And you know you hurt him too 
And the road not taken looks real good now 
Time flies messy as the mud on your truck tires 
Now I all for you like Janet 
Can this be a real thing Can it

Standing by and waiting at your back door 
Do wait or say a single vow

And the road not taken looks real good now 
Time flies messy as the mud on your truck tires

Can this be a real thing Can it
