"at anything else now that I thought of you 
I laugh and I play and I wasnt gon na stray 
Swore Id never let a man in my way 
Youre the last thing I needed today 

And I remember thinking 

Are we falling like snow at the beach Snow at the beach 
Weird but fuckin beautiful

Tonight feels impossible
