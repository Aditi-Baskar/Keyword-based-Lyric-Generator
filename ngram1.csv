"let me love you let me want you 
You just see right through me 
But if you only knew me 
We could be a beautiful miracle unbelievable 
Instead of just invisible 

Oh yeah oh 

There a fire inside of you 
Anytime you feel danger or fear 
Then instantly 
I will appear 

I every woman 
It all in me yeah oh yeah 
I can read your thoughts right now 
Every one from A to Z 

I can cast a spell 
See but you ca tell

"Shining in the moonlight was falling 
You were riding backwards in a dusty window pane 

Angels fly in the air tonight 
Saying was it just like swimming out on the lake 
Stars collide in the air so light 
Was it just like those promises that you made On our last night 
Oh oh oh whoa whoa yeah ohEmbed 
And all the pages are just slipping through my hands 
And Im so scared of how this ends 

Bye bye to everything I thought was on my side 
Bye bye baby

"Cute teddy of mine 
We meet up every Tuesday night for dinner and a glass of wine 
Este been losin sleep 
Her husband actin different and it smells like infidelity 
She says That ai my Merlot on his mouth 
That ai my jewelry on our joint account 
No there ai no doubt 
Somebody got ta catch him out 

I think he knows 
When we get all alone 
I make myself at home 
And he want me to stay

"You broke thy heart win woahEmbed 

This love this love this love this love oh 
This love this love this love 

Your kiss my cheek I watched you leave 
Your smile my ghost I fell to my knees 
When you young you just run 
But you come back to what you need 
This love is good this love is bad 
This love is alive back from the dead oh 
These hands had to let it go free and 
This love came back to me 
I ca help but wish you took ",1
"Fast show some speed on the column and a dent in the door 
A young girl two hands on the wheel 
I ca replace the way it made me feel 
And I would turn her sharp 
I would make it whine 
He say You ca beat the way a old wood boat rides 
Just a little lake across the Alabama line 
But I was king of the ocean 
When Daddy let me drive 

Soon I be grown up 
With daughters of my own 
I let them drive my old jeep 
Across ",1
