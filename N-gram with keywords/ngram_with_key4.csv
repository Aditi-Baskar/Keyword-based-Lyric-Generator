"long time going going 

I so in love he swears 
As he runs his fingers through his hair 
Im laughing I hope he wrong 
And I can see us lostin the memory 
August slipped away into a moment in time 

I love you swear by the freckles on the moon 
And maybe this will be enough

Breathe without you but I have to go that far

Now you all I want is you

Catastrophic blues 
Movin on was always easy for me to use 
Something happened for the first time what past is past

Sweet dreams of holly and ribbon 
Mistakes are forgiven

Losing him was blue like I never known 
Missing him was dark gray all alone Whoa 
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met

She know the way and then she say she got the map from me 
Tell me why you could see what I was thinkin you 


You were breaking down

Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind 
Head on the pillow where you used to tell me I wo let you go 
So then you go 
You should think about the consequence 
Of you touching my hand in a darkened room Dark room dark room 
And see that we 
Were never really meant to be caged in
