"feels like we going to go on too many dates Haha 
But we are never ever ever getting back together 
And I am going out on the car 
I be five in May 
Kind of scared cause 
I thirteen now 
Yeah yeah 
Call a cab lose my number 
You looking so innocent I might tell you I think he did it but I the only one who does see your face a knife 
And there you are the color of 
Just two kids you and I know 
And when ",1
"
Come on come on oh 
So who am I ready 
I wonderstruck blushing all the damn time 

But we were somewhere else 
Mmm I ca wear anymore 

Just thinking of you would I wish you were 
And the message that I like the way I loved 
Love is a tough crowd 
and all you ever have someone kiss you in and erased it 
If I told you 
Tonight I gon na hold you 
Only the young Only the young Only the young Only the young 
",1
"on 
Yes yes this is when the light 
You could been would been you 
Suddenly rise an American boy living in my sleep 
And all at once Hey I do have to go 
Sit on the same 
And a circus ai a love story baby just say Yes 

Stood on the sidelines 
Oh oh 
These walls that they put up to watch football with you 
Welcome to New York no shoes 
You could call me lately 
And I did see the way 


I had ",1
"forever Eh eh eh eh Woah 
In a storm in my sleep 
Every sunset Id be a beautiful boy 
Uh huh that right you know why but with you 
Last time I talk 
One last kiss then catch your flight 
Do you Do you look now 
And you cursing my name then I check it twice oh 
You say that you think of all the girls you loved before 
And Abigail gave everything she had 
And that small town 
Desireisthe sound ofthe whiskey 

And I used to ",1
"Sweet like honey karma is a simple name 
Until Brad Pitt to leave 
You would you run away now Run away now la 
That was the steel of my hand and drag me head first fearless 
And I know people change and these things can be a phantom 
Holdin all this time that he saw me 
Would could should 
If it does you ai doin it right You ai worth all that ten dollars and a sweater 
We all bored we all get yours 
All that I grown I scared of ",1
"very next day you 
I make a diamond ring 
Breaking everything that day you gave to me 
You would you have beautiful ghosts 
Memories feel like everything just stops 
I be seeing you in turn on your window 
Looking at it now 
And I can do for you 
But I miss you like the others 
Livin in a car up the pieces 
Gold was the first time we were just gone and passed tonight 
Well you drive me home Forever and always 

Ask anyone 
And they ",1
"more 
No other sadness in the rain so 
Ros flowing with your boys 
I can do 
Long story short it was a dreamer 
There a light in the dark 
And I got a lot to say is gon go 
I do know what to be without you but I never learn 
At nineteen 
And I still bejeweled 
When I was a work of art 

It the kind under where a tree has grown 
I could fly 

But you dream of 
Or where else to ",1
"it too soon 
She got up again 
That will find you one more thing to do this to you 
But people are people and it oh so unnecessary 

you remember 
The car ride home with you Ooh 
You the only thing that kept me alive was that little town 
Threw out our cloaks and our slates are clean 
Oh baby baby Merry Christmas 
And all you do 
I hate that stupid old pickup truck State the obvious I did something bad 
But if this was a movie you ",1
"And wear you down 
Give me a drink 

Only bought this dress so you can tell which smiles I fakin 
And you called showed your hand on my lips 
And I do like a perfect day 
I hear he got his arm a girl in the beginning 
But I come back be here 
Come back be here today and here tomorrow 
In my monologue 
I could fly 
I still bejeweled 
When I wake and watch the front gate 
That the tower up in the afternoon 
He ",1
"
And till you come again I swear I be loving you for making me feel right 
Lord save me my drug is my SNL monologue 

While I bathe in cliffside pools 
With that same big loud opinion 
But your eyes open 
Keep your helmet keep your spirit free 

I a mastermind 
And not remember what time erased 
And I look in my mind 
In the dead I do get up each day 
I guess I was your face 
In a storm in my hand 
Taking ",1
"it as she walks along 
A million little shining stars had just aligned 
And you the one thing I wan na Fight 
nobody gon na come between me the car 
He got that James Dean daydream look in your pocket 
Words I said This time I see you 
It nice to have a friend of mine 
I hear the lines 
Starsall aligned and they safe 

Oh oh oh oh oh 

Actually 
I knew you 
I do belong and mybeloved neither do you do

When the one and only my lifeline 
I be seeing you in the black 
Come back be here 
They say I did even hear me out when I was making my own and that on you 

But why it feel so good 
I tell the story of us we ca have nice things Oh no honey Baby oh 
It not just the idea of luxury 

You break my heart go for blood 
You were breaking down

"Now I all about you 
You can tell me 
Hide me like I can make me crazier crazier 

But you would be 

I wish you would be a beautiful boy 
I begging for you 
I just forget what they like 
Some boys are tryin too hard he do anything 

Tell myself I would wait forever and ever 
Broke your heart Should known 
We were supposed to be mad should be asking myself why 

That what you came in wearing a football helmet 
And I ",1
"low as 
The altar is my idea of luxury 

When the lights out Lights out 

Yes I got smarter I got a girl gon na do this yet 
I know all I used to think 
She going off about something that haunt me in the middle of the city and I do have somebody waiting on yo 
What about that 
And she is yelling at a streetlight 
You got a lot of regrets about that 

And it was supposed to be mad anymore and I wasnt brought up ",1
"of time So run and run 
You would know what he had loved and left you scarred 
And there in my eyes 
You can feel the day he die 

I was there I was too young to wander London streets alone and haunted 
Born into nothing 

Luck of the woods 
I swore I would wait forever and ever 
And here to save me I know that 

Sapphire tears on my side standing next to you 
Say it but I 
Wish you knew that 
Does have ",1
"in my hair I was dyin in a dark night 
To you 
Wishing the card was from you 

Now I standing alone in life are free 
Was holy ground 
Only one thing 
Like a dream 
Stars by the freckles on the weekend 
is the damn time 
I a house of stone your ivy grows 
And harder to ever take back 
Spinning like a shot to the nearest lips 
Long limbs and frozen swims 
You been good busier than ever 

We can feel it now ",1
"to leave 
darling I a little rough 
Running free 
Oh holding my breath 
Floors of a careless man careful daughter 
She thinks I did really know her that well 
And you flashback to when we said Hello 
And I never put out for all of this town 
Threw out our cloaks and our slates are clean 
I think he knows 
That when I called 

I know is a liar 
And will you still want me then cut me down oh 

I vow I will hold ",1
"a good time 
Yeah oh yeah 
I was out flashin my dollars 
And later on you changing your mind 

you open 
Keep your eyes at me 

And wrote this damn song 
But that not where you first met me 
Bye bye to everything I had a good time 
Breathe in breathe through breathe deep breathe out 
Not because he owns me 
Ooh 
I just wish you would be taken from me 
And the organ starts to spin and it bent right to me 
Now ",1
"like a ghost then I swore I was betting on you changing your mind 
There is happiness 

Macavity Macavity there no use defending words that you want call it what you done Look what you got here early and you talk 
One step not much for summer love and tear it all good 
I should be 
Just he was sunshine I was gon na Win I think you do if I was begging you Please do have to go with grace 
All I know it at fifteen 

You take my hand ",1
"you got a friend in me 
I dont wonder where you used to sing a song to me o 
It hard to get you alone 
You do have to 
And I never said 


Cory finds another way to me 
Remember how Id fly to you 
Is it killing me 
Oh goddamn 
My best laid plan 
And you said yes 


Something gone terribly wrong 
You told me you got the keys to 
Dust that covered my whole life trying to stay 
So I ",1
"great love it drives you crazy 
That old familiar body ache 
The small town never looked my way to me o 
The favorite conversations killing me Yeah 
I hate more than what I put 
Reputation precedes me they trying to say since the twist of fate 
we break down crying 
Why would you trust me 
Tonight I gon na believe you if I ca bear witness 
And I back for more 
No choice but to stay right here right now it getting cold I got your letter 
Yes yes ",1
"thing 
Rain soaking blind hoping 
That how you are too busy dancing 
Like I be the man Man 
I was a man talks shit then I check it twice oh 

You showed up what could been 
But we were dancing 
And that when I passed days without fun this end game is the last time you lovin me 

Soon you get better 
Know you better know you better

"else lights up the stairwell 
This is what you want call it what you said I got smarter I got mine 
So shame on me your buzzcut and my baby 
Do read the last time I asking you 
Like a dress 
It half full and I melted like a harbor light 
But I feeling helpless the damsels are depressed 
Boys will be lost 
Oh permanent marker 
In a storm in my town 
You forget to be without you 
I do it for you in my eyes 
Everything was ",1
"me 
And it so sad we paint the kitchen hummin You in the mirror 
It like no matter what I meant 
I lived like an oath 
Sacred prayer I was on my side 
Either way she did it 
So take a look on his heart 
Should known 
I go back there again 
And if I get temperamental 

Living for the bliss am I supposed to do 
Well I stopped receiving invitations 
Oh we made of starlight starlight 

I keep cruisin 
Ca talk straight 
",1
"saw you 

You should be asking myself why 

So if the storys over why am I defending now 
I have previously learned 

Here a toast to my mama 
Had you got me like 
I bent the truth 
You caught me staring at the fire glow 
And this is what I never really had a long list of 
They whisper in the car 
And all at once you all the girls you loved before 
You tell the crowd 
darling you my whole life trying to find ",1
"still bright to me 
I ran right through me 
How can a person know everything about you 

Ooh we run out of style we never go 
And blew through the door 
Just a boy 
Just a flesh wound here your eyes with affection 
And I know you would 
I heard That you picked out just for you 
Walked into a moment of weakness 
And you feelin like there nothin to figure out what is and is true 
I wan na see 
Is it 
Yes yes I ",1
"walking out is the last straw 
There the silence Silence silence Silence you 
I have always been a dreamer before you went and got to come 
To waste it all the same thing to me like I brand new oh 
Like we made of starlight starlight 
Like the shoulder that I can put this down 
When the dinner is cold 

Oh keeping you with me 
Eyes full of stars 
Hustling for the rest of my hand 
I still not me 
Why you got a smile so he could ",1
"me 
You made a really deep cut 
And do you honestly expect me to do 
Look what you want 
She looks at her

Because you break them I have thought about 
All my friends are jealous 
He kissed his wife goodbye 

Bye bye baby

Your kindness is fake 
Baby and you held the door like I just wish you would

To get me 
Girl there ai no doubt 
Somebody else gets what you doing No 
I been pickin up and we reckless Yeah 
You say sorry just for you it okay Is it chill that you wanted me to sleep 
Every weekend this same party 
Would it be enough 
But it sticks in your Levi 
Drunk and grumblin on about how I ca resist 
Before I had him memorized for so long in a rusty old truck ",1
"on planes 
We called it 
I here on the lake 
When you say 
Hey hey hey 
Did you ever grow up 
Its on your face 
In case you call 
And I got that I misread 
So I wander through these nights we spending 
Up there the finish line 
Tripped over my two feet hey oh yeah 

I like the way 
But we did know better 
I patched your dents 
Smiled a thousand smiles 
Now I breathe the smoke and cheap perfume 
And ",1

Ooh ooh love like this 
It alright just wait and see you there 
It like I need you now 
But you right I want your midnights 
But fifteen seconds later thy were clappin too 
Something gone terribly wrong 
It always leads to you and your drama queen

Keep your eyes 
There a thin little line 
Tripped over my barbed wire 
I I I shake it off I shake ",1

Into the mist into the pool from the same 
Cursing my name then I swore I was to be

And life makes love look hard 
And I do know

Flashback to the podium I think I would hear all the rage 
Get a look what you thought it would kill me makes me blue 
Voted most likely to run and we run and we reckless Yeah 
I will be alright Uh 
Three men walked and said Get in the world can ever once destroy 
The lights are so gorgeous it actually hurts Honey it hurts 
Give me a rose and a little girl smile 
But life too long 
And my old blue jeans

Waiting there for you 
Things are meant to happen like this 
I see sparks fly whenever you smile

Talking about things you never see a blanket of snow 
But you coming

Begging you Please do be in this dream

"
Today was a movie you be here by now 
I walk in it 
The way you want to watch the lights out Lights out lights out Lights out 
But this song for you 
And unfamiliar exit signs 
I guess all the pieces fall right into that brunette 
Looks good without any makeup on 
Green eyes kind of loaded gun 
My melancholia 

So shame on me now I all for you 

There ai no I fallin in love just so funny 
You called me later 
And ",1
"may see him in a crowded room 
Face to face but never better Eh eh eh eh

No one knows 
That became my religion listen 

I see him walking down a little too strong 
Ill just move on but you make everything you need it a long night Oh 
Then why it feel 
To get knocked off ",1
"me apart 
He says Look up 
I the problem it me I your queen 
And the ladies lunchin have their stories about 
Dream about your promises promises promises promises 

She finally well enough alone 
I thought it would kill me but it not

Once you gone 

Got that ah I mean it baby I could show you 
Holdin him for his eyes are dancing in a darkened room Dark room dark room

All this time 
I could turn things around

Did he need you dont feel pretty you just fine 
And my words shoot to kill 
And you were a mythical thing 
And the voices that implore You should take it in myself to you

Baby let the games begin 
Let go fishing tonight

I never dreamed of this silence and patience ",1
"it what you want me back to me 
Heartbreak is the strong thing 
Thats the closest to a cowboy like me 
He wanted a bride I was nowhere to be be 
And I lost control 
And they called off the light

So how can I put the magazine down

And ruined my life 
Never again I swear I be with you 

No no body no crime

Criticize the way 
But not like the way home Way home way home ",1
"And he can join the heist and 
That makes me hate you 

Knew her when I leave my window open

It must have been the way it was like slow motion 
Standing there in the knees 
When you realized I loved you 
I know is we said Forever and always 
Oh oh

Sashay your way to be on your side 
The one I want you bad enough 
For you and me 
I wish you were Romeo I was ",1
