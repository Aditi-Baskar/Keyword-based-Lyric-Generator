Beggin for forgiveness beggin for me 
Just like I always wanted 
But I so sorry 

I not your princess this ai our fairytale 
I gon na find someone someday who might actually treat me well 
This is a big world that was a small town

"Christmas 
Where every wish comes true 
In my heart is a Christmas tree farm 
There a light in the barn 
We run inside out from the cold 
In the town kids are dreamin of sleighs 
And they warm and they safe 
They wake to see a blanket of snow 

Sweet dreams of holly and ribbon 
Mistakes are forgiven 
And everythin is icy and blue 
And you would be there too 

Under the mistletoe 
Watchin the fire glow 
And tellin me I love you
